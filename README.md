Dgkann Dice Game
================

This is a simple and fun two-player dice game. Players take turns rolling the dice to accumulate points, and the first player to reach 100 points wins the game. The project is developed with a modern and clean interface.

How to Play
-----------

The goal of the game is to be the first to reach **100 points**.

1.  **Roll the dice:** The current player clicks the "Roll dice" button. The rolled number is added to the player's "CURRENT" score.
    
2.  **Hold:** The player can click the "Hold" button to add their "CURRENT" score to their main score and pass the turn to the opponent.
    
3.  **Watch out!:** If the player rolls a **1**, their "CURRENT" score is reset, and the turn immediately passes to the other player.
    
4.  **New Game:** The "New game" button resets all scores and starts the game over.
    
5.  **Personalization:** You can change the background color of the game using the color picker in the top-right corner.
